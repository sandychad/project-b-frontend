          <h3 class='ss-color'>SymScreen â€“ How It Works?</h3>
          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A safe work environment requires employees working in proximity
              and those infected with Covid-19 are not allowed inside, thereby
              an Office is not a place where Covid-19 infection is spread.
            </li>
            <li>
              A self-assessment by employees with consent is the best mechanism
              to ensure health and safety of everyone working in close
              proximity.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Setup</h4>
          <ul class='a'>
            <li>
              A kiosk with tablet / touch-PC and a thermometer is setup at the
              entrance to an office.
            </li>
            <li>
              An employee overseeing physical security of the building (ex:
              Building receptionist) logs into the SymScreen cloud app at the
              kiosk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any employee coming into the building completes survey in under 30
              seconds and if successful enters office.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Data Recording</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Measure body temperature</li>
            <li>Employee selects his/her name</li>
            <li>
              Enters temperature, answers few questions, and submits survey
            </li>
